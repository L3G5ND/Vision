# About
An easy to use UI library for Roblox Lua. Currently there is no documentation. This project was designed for personal use, though was made public for anyone to use.

# Motivation
I made this project to compensate with Roact. 

Why? 
- You cant wrap existing UI Elements into a Roact Tree
- I didn't like some of Roacts syntax
- I wanted to add some if my own features that Roact didn't have to make UI development easier
- I wanted to add more flexibility with Components

# Bonuses
- Anyone who is familiar with Roact can easily learn Vision.
